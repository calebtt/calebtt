# Hi there! 👋 I'm Caleb

🌱 **Currently diving into Multi-paradigm Design in C++** (while sneaking in some C# voice AI experiments).  
📫 **Best way to reach me:** Email preferred. Cell available by request for faster back-and-forth. NashDev Slack for Nashville locals.  
📍 **Nashville, TN** – Always up for coffee chats on .NET, C++, or building voice agents.

I'm a software engineer passionate about low-level systems, AI-driven tools, and cross-platform libraries. Lately, I've been building C#/.NET components for voice processing, speaker diarization, and intelligent agents—perfect for telephony and real-time apps. Check out my recent work below!

## Featured Projects

### Voice AI & Telephony Tools (Recent C# Focus)
These are my latest C# repos, emphasizing minimal, efficient libraries for speech detection, diarization, and agentic workflows. They're battle-tested in noisy environments and utilize AI models like Silero VAD, ecapa-tdnn, whisper, and phi3.

- **[MinimalSileroVad](https://github.com/calebtt/MinimalSileroVad)**  
  ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%23-brightgreen)  
  Cross-platform .NET library for VAD (Voice Activity Detection) and speech segmentation using the Silero VAD model. Replaces WebRtcVadSharp—faster and more accurate for real-time apps.

- **[MinimalVoiceAgent](https://github.com/calebtt/MinimalVoiceAgent)**  
  ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%23-brightgreen)  
  A lightweight voice agent framework with tool calling, local TTS/STT, and Grok API integration. Build conversational AI without the bloat—ideal for prototypes or embedded systems.

- **[SipBotOpen](https://github.com/calebtt/SipBotOpen)** *(Highlighted Project)*  
  ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%23-brightgreen)  
  Open-source telephone voice assistant with tool calling and PSTN connectivity. Dial it live at **1-615-899-3280**! Uses SIP client in C# .NET for VoIP PBX magic. Currently testing VAD, AEC, and noise suppression.

- **[MinimalDiarization](https://github.com/calebtt/MinimalDiarization)**  
  ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%23-brightgreen)  
  .NET library for AI-powered speaker diarization via ONNX runtime. Includes experimental intent preprocessing for command discrimination in noisy, multi-speaker scenarios—great for voice agents.

### Other Highlights
- **[XMapLib](https://github.com/calebtt/XMapLib)**  
  ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%2B%2B-blue) ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/calebtt/XMapLib)  
  Low-level C++ library for mapping Xbox controller inputs to keyboard/mouse. Closer to the metal for gaming/input hacks.

- **[StreamToActionTranslator](https://github.com/calebtt/StreamToActionTranslator)**  
  ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%2B%2B-blue)  
  C++23 CMake project for translating input streams to actionable function calls. Experimental fun with streams and actions.

## Talks & Inspirations
Some of my favorite [CppCon talks](https://pastebin.com/raw/xyz123) that keep me sharp. Planning to dive deeper into C# async patterns next—stay tuned!

More code, tools, and experiments coming soon. Contributions welcome—fork away! 🚀
