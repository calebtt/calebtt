- 👋 Hi, I’m @calebtt
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering (design), 3D printing, 3d modeling
- 🌱 I’m currently reading about Multi-paradigm design in C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Most of my mental energies spent at work (that's a good thing!)
- 📫 How to reach me, email preferred or ask for cell # for more direct communication.

-Temp-humid-sensor-Arduino, an embedded dev project using an Arduino uno wifi rev2 (ATmega4809 8-bit microcontroller), 
currently it provides an OLED display of the current temp and humidity, and the activation temp range, with a rotary encoder knob 
to adjust the activation temperature for a connected relay. It can be used to turn devices on or off at a certain temperature (heater, etc.) 
Being fully programmable, it is probably the most flexible solution there is compared to on shelf products.

-XMapLib, a closer to the metal native C++ Windows API (XINPUT lib) Xbox controller to keyboard and mouse input project.
Check out the XmapLib branch composability-and-modularity for a better approach wip.

-HookSpeech, native C++ using low level Windows API hooks and a C# GUI wrapper all coming together to allow the user to easily replace their keyboard alphabet with another, on the fly.

-AutoRenameEdit.py, a Python app to quickly rename an entire directory of image files with new names drawn from
a large dictionary file, randomly.

-BuildRandomLib, a few handy function templates for filling an stl container or qualified range container with randomly generated elements.
Useful in unit testing to throw mass amounts of random data at an interface and see if it fails.

<br>If I had started using Github sooner, there would be a lot more projects here!
