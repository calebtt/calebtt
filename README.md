- 👋 Hi, I’m @calebtt
- 🌱 I’m currently reading about Multi-paradigm design in C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Most of my mental energies spent at work (that's a good thing!)
- 📫 How to reach me, email preferred, teams or ask for cell # for more direct communication.

-XMapLib_Keyboard, a native C++ controller to keyboard and mouse input project. Described as: Flexible, and Exceptional small library for adding controller input to action mapping.

-HookSpeech, native C++ using low level Windows API hooks and a C# GUI wrapper all coming together to allow the user to easily replace their keyboard alphabet with another, on the fly.

**A shortlist of some of the CppCon videos I like most**
