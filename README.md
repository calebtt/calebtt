-HookSpeech, a project made of 3 projects, a C/C++ DLL, a C++/CLI class library around some of it's functions, and a C# GUI project;
all coming together to allow the user to easily replace their keyboard alphabet with another, on the fly.

a large dictionary file, randomly.


If only I had started using Github sooner, there would be a lot more projects here!
