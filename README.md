# 👋 Hi, I’m @calebtt

- 🌱 Currently diving into *Multi-paradigm Design in C++*
- 💡 Building two **web-based tech businesses** — more soon as they go live!
- 🤖 Always down to collaborate on something interesting in **AI/ML**
- 📫 Best way to reach me: email preferred. Cell available by request for faster back-and-forth. NashDev slack for Nashville local.

### 🚧 Projects in Progress

- **StreamToActionTranslator**  
  Refactored `XMapLib` code; highly performant, averaging ~5μs per state machine iteration (with filtering).  
  Built with **stateful, loosely coupled pipeline classes/functions**. Preference for **free functions** where practical.

- **XMapLib_Keyboard**  
  A native C++ library that maps **controller input to keyboard/mouse events**.  
  Described as: *“Flexible and exceptional”* — a compact, powerful input-mapping layer for native apps.

- **HookSpeech**  
  Low-level Windows API hooks in C++, with a C# GUI wrapper.  
  Replaces your keyboard alphabet on the fly — dynamic remapping made seamless.

### 💻 Two Website-Based Tech Ventures Launching Soon
I’m working on two online platforms — both are grounded in real-world workflows and automation.  
Expect a mix of:
- C++ websockets backends (boost asio, boost beast, ssl websockets)
- C# ASP.NET REST servers on VPSs, websockets web client
- Javascript and HTML front-ends

More details (and code) coming soon.

> *If I’d started using GitHub earlier, there’d be a lot more stuff here.*  
> That said, expect more code, tools, and ideas to show up soon.
