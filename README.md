- 👋 Hi, I’m @calebtt
- 🌱 I’m currently reading about Multi-paradigm design in C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Something open source AI/ML related. mdspan coming soon will be a fun tool.
- 📫 How to reach me, email preferred, teams or ask for cell # for more direct communication.

-StreamToActionTranslator, refactored XMapLib code, highly performant in comparison averaging ~5 microseconds per iteration of the state machine (with filter obj in the pipeline) on my rig. Uses stateful loosely coupled pipeline classes and functions, prefers free functions.
-XMapLib_Keyboard, a native C++ controller to keyboard and mouse input project. Described as: Flexible, and Exceptional small library for adding controller input to action mapping.
-HookSpeech, native C++ using low level Windows API hooks and a C# GUI wrapper all coming together to allow the user to easily replace their keyboard alphabet with another, on the fly.

<br>If I had started using Github sooner, there would be a lot more projects here!
