- 👋 Hi, I’m @calebtt
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering (design), CNC Machining, Business, Real Estate, Finance, Crypto
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Xamarin cross-platform mobile apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: (top of the list) large C++ projects, or a cool .NET API
- 📫 How to reach me mounteriemachine@hotmail.com or instagram message, ask for cell # for more direct communication.

-Home of Xinmapper, a native C++ Windows API (XINPUT lib) Xbox 360 controller to keyboard and mouse input project.

-HookSpeech, a project made of 3 projects, a C/C++ DLL, a C++/CLI class library around some of it's functions, and a C# GUI project;
all coming together to allow the user to easily replace their keyboard alphabet with another, on the fly.

-AutoRenameEdit.py, a Python app to quickly rename an entire directory of image files with new names drawn from
a large dictionary file, randomly.


If only I had started using Github sooner, there would be a lot more projects here!
