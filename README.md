- 👋 Hi, I’m @calebtt
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering (design), CNC Machining, Business, Real Estate, Finance, Crypto
- 🌱 I’m currently reading <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/c-plus-plus-concurrency-in-action-second-edition"> C++ Concurrency in Action 2nd ed.</a>
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: (top of the list) large C++ projects, or a cool .NET API
- 📫 How to reach me, email preferred or ask for cell # for more direct communication.

-XMapLib, a closer to the metal native C++ Windows API (XINPUT lib) Xbox controller to keyboard and mouse input project.
Check out the XmapLib branch thumbbehavior for a C# GUI implementation work in progress.

-Xinmapper, a native C++ Windows API (XINPUT lib) Xbox 360 controller to keyboard and mouse input project. [deprecated by XMapLib]

-Weebumconfig, a C# .NET 5.0 gui interface for using FFMPEG to convert video files to the WEBM format in a much easier more user-friendly way.

-HookSpeech, native C++ using low level Windows API hooks and a C# GUI wrapper all coming together to allow the user to easily replace their keyboard alphabet with another, on the fly.

-AutoRenameEdit.py, a Python app to quickly rename an entire directory of image files with new names drawn from
a large dictionary file, randomly.

<br>If only I had started using Github sooner, there would be a lot more projects here!
